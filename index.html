               <p>Where were you when love called? Is it fair to blame anyone 
                  right now that you feel so cheated? <br>Listen to M.Scott, 
                  “The truth is that our finest moments are most likely to occur
                   when we are feeling deeply uncomfortable, unhappy, or unfulfilled. 
                   For it is only in such moments, propelled by our discomfort, that we are
                    likely to step out of our ruts and start searching for different ways or truer answers.
                    Genuine love is volitional rather than emotional. The person who truely loves does so
                     because of a decision to love. This person has made a commitment to be loving whether 
                     or not the loving feeling is present. ...Conversely, it is not only possible but necessary 
                     for a loving person to avoid acting on feelings of love. Abandon the urge to simplify everything, 
                     to look for formulas and easy answers, and to begin to think multidimensionally, to glory in the
                      mystery and paradoxes of life, not to be dismayed by the multitude of causes and consequences
                       that are inherent in each experience -- to appreciate the fact that life is complex”</p>

              <p>Is it not funny that a call from love was what you were expecting for so long? You sat right in front of your phone and waited for so long that your grass become overgrown, your dishes piled up and your PS4 order of 4 weeks finally arrived but you did not have a care in the world for anything like that. 
                So, your clothes probably started feeling sticky and the stench from the kitchen started getting your stomach upset and was it not a better time to start playing your PS4? At least, you'd be ale to say something when your folks raise a similar topic on twitter and you know, you know how much you wanted to stay away from twitter, all those guys flaunting their babes...all those ladies ending up with jerk! 
                Well, that's that. You stood up and started going back to what life was before the consciousness of waiting for a call from love arose within you.
                
                It's so heart-breaking that when love calls, you might be playing your PS4, you might be busy in the kitchen, or mowing your grass, or doing just aout anything that keeps you away from picking your calls.<br>
                
                At <span style="color: #F0BD00;">ILetHeart</span>, we ensure you do not have to sit for so long, in fact, you do not have to sit at all. 
                We are hands in hands with you to walk you down the path of discovery and we stop only when you have gotten to the door of love. 
                And no, you do not receive the call, we help you make the call, and is that really a call in your language? You literarily only have to knock. Your hearthrob is ever at the other side of the door to let you in. 
                
                So, why dont you let us start this journey with you?</p>
